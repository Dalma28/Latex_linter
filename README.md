							## Latex linter

Latex linter is a program for editing and reformatting latex files.


							   ## Usage

You can run the program directly from application file. The program will make an edited copy of your original latex file.
If you want to have more than one edited file, then please MOVE the first edited file to another folder then run the program. Otherwise the editing will be done on the same file every time you run the program.

							##Rules editing

You can activate and deactivate the rules. You can even decide how many blank lines you want to be added. To do that please follow the instructions below:
⦁	Open the file “rules”
⦁	Give the value “true” if you want the rule to be activated and the value “false” if you want to deactivate the rule
⦁	You can change the number of added blank lines by changing the number after “number_of_lines” in the rules file 
⦁	PLEASE do not give any other value and do not do any other changes on the file

							##Error messages

When you get an error message then you have edited the rules file wrongly or gave an unvalid value. Then please type back the old value or redownload the rules file.

Note: Only latex files are accepted and no other formats.
Note: Please have the file that you want to edit in the same directory (folder) otherwise you are going to get an error message.
